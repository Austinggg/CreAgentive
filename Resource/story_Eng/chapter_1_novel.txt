Silent Systems

The crew quarters vibrated with an unnatural hum as the fluorescent lights overhead stuttered like failing stars. Chen Xiaodao’s digital watch face fizzed into static, the numbers melting into gray snow. He tapped it twice—his mother’s birthday gift, always reliable—but the screen only pulsed in protest. Across the narrow hallway, the crew communicator mounted on the wall emitted a high-pitched whine before going dark.  

"Prime numbers," came a murmur from the adjacent bunk. One of the engineers sat up, rubbing his temples. "Lights keep flickering in sequences of seven, then eleven..."  

Chen tightened the cuffs of his long-sleeved uniform, scanning the corridor. The ship’s nightly rhythms were as familiar to him as his own pulse, but this was wrong. He slipped a notepad from his breast pocket, scribbling the exact time and the pattern: *03:17 AM. Lights. Watch. Comms. Total blackout—11 seconds.* His pen froze mid-sentence as a shadow flickered past the doorway.

The passenger corridor swallowed sound like a tomb. Chen moved silently past cabin doors, his polished shoes leaving no trace on the carpet. Then: the whisper of fabric against metal. He pressed himself against a service alcove, counting breaths—*one, three, five*—as two figures emerged from restricted areas at opposite ends of the hall.  

Lin Xiu’s gloved left hand hovered near an electrical panel, his mismatched eyes scanning the ceiling cameras. Twenty meters away, Dr. Su Mingyue’s fingers twitched at her sides, her lips moving as if reciting equations. Chen’s throat tightened. Neither should have been here. The doctor’s obsessive rituals belonged in the infirmary; the gambler’s calculated poise reeked of a bluff in progress.  

The lights shuddered again. Chen’s notepad trembled in his grip as he watched Lin’s golden eye gleam in the brief darkness—fixated not on Su Mingyue, but on something beneath their feet.

The service elevator groaned as it descended, its mirrored walls trapping Chen in a kaleidoscope of his own wary reflection. Through the vent slats, he caught flashes of Lin Xiu crouched by a junction box, a stripped wire sparking between his fingers. The gambler’s right hand moved with surgical precision—too precise for mere sabotage.  

*That’s not disconnection.* Chen’s pulse hammered. *He’s rerouting something.*  

The elevator jerked to a halt between floors. In the sudden stillness, he heard Lin’s voice, low and honeyed: "—phase variance won’t hold unless we sync the inverters." No response came, but Chen could’ve sworn the shadows near the ceiling shifted.  

He pressed his UV-sensitive wrist to the cold metal door, counting the seconds until motion resumed. Eleven exactly.

The staff locker room smelled of bleach and sweat. Su Mingyue’s locker—third from the left, combination lock—yielded to Chen’s practiced twist. Inside, between neatly folded scrubs, lay a blueprint of the *Phantom*’s electrical grid, annotated in precise, looping script.  

*Phase couplers tagged in red.* His fingertips brushed circles drawn around key junctions—each one a match for tonight’s blackouts. Beneath them, a footnote: *"Temporal displacement increases with voltage flux. Subject D (cardiac history) exhibits 200% chrono-sensitivity."*  

A rustle came from the doorway. Chen barely had time to stuff the papers back before a voice cleaved the silence:  

"You look lost."  

Su Mingyue stood framed in fluorescent light, her coat sleeves rolled to reveal track marks along both arms—not from needles, Chen realized, but from something that left burns in perfect geometric patterns.

The storage room’s air tasted of ozone and old seawater. Crates labeled *1983* lined the walls, their latches rusted shut. At the room’s center, Su Mingyue and Lin Xiu faced each other across a sprawl of equipment—glass tubes humming with violet light, a console blinking in a language Chen didn’t recognize.  

"There’s no alignment without the third point," Su hissed, her prime-number count abandoned. She gripped a silver device like a scalpel.  

Lin’s laugh was a dry thing. "You think I’d trust you with the harmonics?" His gloved hand hovered near his waistband—where Chen knew he kept a blade etched with the same symbols now flickering across the console.  

Neither noticed Chen in the doorway. Neither noticed the ship’s clock, frozen at 2:03 AM for the past seventeen minutes.  

Then the lights died completely, and the *scream* began—not from the machinery, but from the deck below, where no passenger cabins existed.  

Chen’s notepad hit the floor, his pen rolling toward a crate stenciled with words that hadn’t been there before: *CARGO HOLD-DELTA. AUTHORIZED EYES ONLY.*  

The pen stopped against Lin Xiu’s shoe. The gambler’s golden eye found Chen in the dark.  

"Ah," he said softly. "Right on time."
