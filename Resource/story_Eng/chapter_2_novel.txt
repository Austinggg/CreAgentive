Clash of Secrets

The storage room’s fluorescent lights buzzed like angry hornets, their flicker casting erratic shadows across stacked crates. Lin Xiu’s golden eye glinted as he adjusted the black glove on his left hand—a habit whenever he felt cornered. 

"You *knew*," Chen Xiaodao accused, his voice tight. The ship’s hum vibrated through the steel floorboards beneath their feet. "This equipment isn’t just broken—it’s *recognizing* us."

Su Mingyue clenched her fists, the digits of π scrolling behind her eyelids—3.1415—a mental tic to steady herself. The ozone tang in the air made her nostrils flare. "The diagnostic logs show temporal markers. Like it’s been... waiting."

Lin Xiu’s smile didn’t reach his mismatched eyes. "Doctor, surely you don’t believe—"

"—that a ghost ship cares about poker debts?" Chen stepped forward, deliberately blocking Su Mingyue from Lin Xiu’s line of sight. His long sleeves brushed against a dormant console, UV-proof fabric whispering against metal. "We found your access logs. Every system failure coincides with *your* movements."

The glove creaked as Lin Xiu flexed his fingers. "Interesting theory from a *waiter*." His voice dripped honeyed venom. "But theories won’t—"

A klaxon screamed. The gravity plating shuddered, sending crates crashing. Chen grabbed Su Mingyue’s wrist—ice-cold, always ice-cold when her anesthesia immunity kicked in—as the world fragmented. 

For three impossible seconds, the storage room overlaid with itself: rusted walls bleeding through polished steel, Lin Xiu’s face flickering between youth and decay. 

Su Mingyue staggered free, prime numbers tumbling from her lips. "It’s not malfunctioning. It’s *sampling* time periods." Her finger jabbed at a readout now showing dual timestamps—2003/2023. "We’re caught in the original disappearance event." 

Lin Xiu lunged for the door. Chen moved faster, leveraging the ship’s sudden tilt to tackle him. They crashed into cables that sparked with blue light—not electricity, but something older. Lin Xiu’s snarl morphed into shock as the wires pulsed against his bare wrist, revealing scars too precise for accidents. 

Chen’s mind raced. *Cheater’s marks. He’s modified his own nervous system.* 

A shove sent them sprawling apart just as reality snapped back. Normal gravity returned with a nauseating lurch. 

"Hold him!" Su Mingyue yelled, but Lin Xiu was already gone, the crew corridor swallowing his footsteps. 

Chen hesitated at the threshold. Emergency lights painted the narrow passage in bloody red, his UV allergy prickling at the unnatural hue. "We need proof before confronting him again."

Su Mingyue wiped sweat from her brow. "He’ll head for communications. To warn someone—or *something*—that we’re getting close." 

The radio room’s door hung ajar, its hinges groaning like a wounded animal. Inside, Lin Xiu hunched over the main transmitter, fingers flying across Bakelite switches older than Chen himself. Static hissed from speakers, resolving into a voice from 2003: "*Mayday, this is Pacific Star—*"

Lin Xiu’s head whipped toward them. "You hear that? *They’re still alive.*" His manic grin faltered as Chen pressed record on his phone—not that modern tech should work here. "How are you—"

"Trade secret." Chen kept the device angled to capture both the transmission and Lin Xiu’s scarred hands. "You didn’t just *find* this ship. You *summoned* it."

Outside, dawn crept across the portholes. Su Mingyue gripped a med-kit like a weapon. "We have six days until the next convergence." Her voice softened despite herself. "Help us stabilize the rift, and I’ll forgive your debt."

Lin Xiu’s gloves tensed around a dial. For the first time, Chen saw real fear in those odd-colored eyes. "You don’t understand. Some debts..." The radio squawked with overlapping distress calls—past and present harmonizing. "*...can’t be repaid.*"
