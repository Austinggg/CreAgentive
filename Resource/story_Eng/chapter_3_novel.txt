Temporal Experiment

The static-charged air in the Temporal Stabilization Chamber clung to Su Mingyue's skin like damp gauze. She counted the flickering shadows dancing across the console—seventeen, nineteen, twenty-three—her fingers automatically adjusting dials to prime numbers only. The machinery hummed at a frequency that made her fillings ache.  

"Steward Chen?" She didn't turn from the readouts. "Hand me the cortical suppressors. The silver ones, not the black."  

Chen Xiaodao's gloved hands trembled slightly as he passed the surgical kit. His sleeves were buttoned at the wrists despite the tropical heat, the UV-protected fabric straining over forearms already showing strange discolorations. "Doctor Su...the calibration sequence here looks familiar. The interface patterns match—"  

"The laundry system, yes." She finally glanced at him, noting how his pupils contracted abnormally in the pulsing light. "You notice things. That's why I requested your assistance instead of the engineers."  

Three decks below in the casino, Lin Xiu's golden-brown eyes tracked the stabilizer readouts mirrored on his illegally modified watch. The left glove flexed around a concealed device humming in sync with Su Mingyue's equipment. His smile showed precisely forty-two teeth—twenty-one upper, twenty-one lower.  

*Let the good doctor play with her temporal theories for now.*  

Up in the Observation Deck, the sea lay preternaturally still. Chen's hidden phone captured the exact moment when Lin Xiu's reflection in the stabilizer display showed different settings than the console's actual readings. The future-model Glock tucked into Lin Xiu's waistband gleamed with an impossible sheen under the flickering lights.  

By midnight, Chen's UV allergy sent jagged pain through his retinas as shadow figures began emerging from the bulkheads—a steward polishing the same railing in three different uniforms simultaneously, a woman in 2000s fashion screaming silently against the porthole glass. His future self stood watching Su Mingyue with a seven-day countdown burned into his forearm.  

"You're bleeding."  

Su Mingyue's clinical voice cut through the visions. Chen looked down to find his sleeve soaked where he'd unconsciously grasped a temporal distortion. Her fingers probed the wound with professional detachment, but her pulse jumped when the burns illuminated under her penlight—a perfect Fibonacci sequence glowing beneath his skin.  

"Fascinating." The prime numbers skipped their usual rhythm in her head. "These patterns suggest your nervous system is naturally syncing with the ship's temporal—"  

A crash from the service elevator interrupted her. Chen spun toward the sound, recognizing the precise two-second hesitation before engagement that marked Lin Xiu's tell. His photographic memory superimposed the scene—casino chips scattered across green felt, a card shark's glove flickering briefly transparent to reveal scar tissue in the shape of a cruise ship's deck plan.  

"Doctor." He blocked Su Mingyue's path to the door, suddenly understanding why his future self had been mouthing *starboard lifeboat*. "We need to—"  

The discovery in his quarters hours later confirmed everything. The spare uniform in his closet bore a service patch dated 2043, the name stitched below it undeniably his own. Chen's hands shook as the wounds on his arm pulsed exactly seven times.  

Somewhere below them, the stabilizer array clicked over to a frequency that matched the black box recordings from twenty years ago—the final transmission of a ship that had never really stopped disappearing.
