The Gambler's Secret

The sterile white walls of the medical bay pulsed with irregular light, casting elongated shadows that flickered like arrhythmic heartbeats. Su Mingyue's fingers twitched as she automatically counted the intervals—three seconds dark, five seconds light—prime numbers registering in her subconscious even as she tore open the emergency kit.

"Hold still," she commanded, though the young steward convulsing on the gurney couldn't obey if he tried. Chen Xiaodao's usually pale skin now glowed with phosphorescent numerals that crawled beneath his epidermis, his lips moving in silent recitation. The stench of burnt copper filled the cramped space.

Su plunged a syringe into the emergency stabilizer solution, her movements precise despite the shaking ship. "This substance isn't in any modern pharmacopeia," she muttered. "But these notes from twenty years ago claim—"

The glowing numbers on Chen's arms suddenly flared white-hot, resolving into latitude and longitude coordinates. Su's breath hitched when she recognized the pattern. "These match the hidden compartments marked in the original schematics," she whispered.

Chen's eyes snapped open, pupils dilated. "Section D-12," he gasped, fingers clawing at the gurney's rails. "That's not a storage room...he's lying..."

Across the ship in the officers' lounge, Lin Xiu's gloved left hand hovered over his poker chips while the captain boasted about the antique temporal stabilizers in the ship's vault. A nearly imperceptible tic disrupted Lin's smile—the golden iris of his left eye contracting a fraction faster than the right.

"Another round, gentlemen?" Lin's voice held just enough hesitation that Chen, now wiping down the serving cart nearby, noted the change. The steward's UV-sensitive phone camera discreetly captured the strange markings on Lin's special chips—glowing faintly like Chen's arm burns had mere hours ago.

When a particularly rough wave sent Chen stumbling into the table, his strategically spilled cocktail hit Lin's lap. The gambler recoiled with an inhuman snarl, his glove slipping to reveal crackling blue energy arcing between his fingers. 

"Temporal feedback!" Su shouted, bursting through the doorway with a loaded syringe. She'd followed the coordinates to this confrontation, the numbers still burning behind her eyelids. 

Lin's weapon phased in and out of reality—something sleek and metallic that shouldn't exist yet. Chen barely dodged the first sizzling blast that left the mahogany paneling undamaged yet reeking of ozone. 

"Doctor now, debts later!" Su plunged the sedative into Lin's neck as their struggling forms crashed against the bulkhead. The syringe's contents reacted violently with the temporal energy, sending pulses of lavender light through Lin's veins before he collapsed. 

Chen wiped his brow, noticing his own arms were clear of the glowing numbers once more. But the maintenance logs he'd photographed in the service corridors told a darker story—seven identical coordinates with seven identical countdowns blinking toward zero.
