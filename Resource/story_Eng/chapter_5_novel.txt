The Compartments of Time

The fluorescent light flickered above Chen Xiaodao’s bunk, casting intermittent shadows across the tiny steward’s quarters. He rolled up his sleeves with practiced care, wincing as the fabric brushed against the lattice of ultraviolet burns staining his forearms. The allergy lamp hummed to life beneath his bunk—his secret diagnostic tool, rigged from a discarded medical device Su Mingyue had smuggled him weeks ago. When the purple glow hit his skin, the scattered burns coalesced into a perfect map of the ship’s lower decks, pulsing where temporal distortions clustered.  

"Prime numbers," he whispered, tracing the brightest node near compartment Gamma. "Seven… nineteen… forty-three." The pattern aligned with the gaps in Lin Xiu’s poker tells—the way the gambler’s gloved left hand always twitched at those intervals.  

A knock came in three precise strokes. Su Mingyue slipped inside before he could answer, her medical bag brushing against the doorframe. She didn’t comment on his exposed arms, though her fingers spasmed at her sides in silent counting—two, three, five, seven—the way they always did when suppressing concern.  

"You’re glowing," she said instead, clinical detachment masking the way her pupils dilated at the bioluminescent map. "Like deep-sea thermal vents."  

Chen unclipped a laundry tag from his uniform. "Hold this to the light." As she angled it beneath the UV bulb, his meticulous stitch-work revealed itself: not cleaning instructions, but a scaled blueprint of Deck 7’s maintenance corridors. Tiny X’s marked where Lin’s security overrides had left scuff marks on access panels.  

Su’s breath hitched at the twelfth prime number. "You’ve been charting temporal eddies with your own capillaries." Her thumb hovered over a cluster of burns near his wrist. "These vectors match the ship’s original disappearance trajectory."  

He jerked his sleeve down. "We need a diversion. Lin’s guarding Gamma compartment like it’s his last poker chip."  

——  

By midnight, Deck 7’s restricted corridor breathed its eerie blue hum through the walls. Chen tipped the industrial bleach bottle with calculated clumsiness, sending acrid liquid pooling across the hallway. The moment Lin’s door hissed open, he dropped into character—apologetic steward voice, shoulders hunched to appear nonthreatening.  

"My deepest apologies, sir! I’ll have this cleaned before—"  

"Idiot." Lin’s mismatched eyes gleamed under the emergency lights. His gloved hand twitched at nineteen seconds exactly as he stepped over the spill. "Watch your step. Some messes can’t be mopped up."  

Chen kept his gaze lowered until Lin’s footsteps faded. Only then did he note the temporal anomaly—a patch of wall where the bleach evaporated upwards in crystalline reverse. His forearm pulsed beneath his sleeve, guiding him toward Gamma.  

——  

The bulkhead groaned open to reveal a chamber where dust motes floated in languid reverse. Su gasped as her stethoscope levitated off her neck, its metal components vibrating at conflicting frequencies.  

"It’s not a compartment," Chen realized, his burns now alight like a constellation. "It’s a—"  

"—temporal capacitor." Su’s trembling fingers brushed the pocketwatch embedded in the steel. Its glass face showed miniature passengers strolling through tiny decks, their movements synced to the countdown glowing across Chen’s arms.  

His own microscopic double looked up from the watch face, mouth open in a scream none of them could hear.
