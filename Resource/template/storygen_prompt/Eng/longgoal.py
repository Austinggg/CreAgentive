## Goals:

## Constraints:

- Maintain a single, standardized output format, containing no spaces, punctuation, or line breaks.

## Workflow:
1. Receive user input: long-term goal {long_goal} and current plan {plan}.
2. Apply the first rule: Check if the plan directly fulfills the core, essential requirements of the long-term goal. If not, prepare to return NO.
3. Apply the second rule: Verify if the plan provides an indispensable and critical foundation for the long-term goal. If not, prepare to return NO.
4. Apply the third rule: Assess if the plan has any conflicts or significant deviations from the long-term goal. If so, prepare to return NO.
5. Synthesize the results: If all rules are met, return YES. Otherwise, or if uncertain about any rule, return NO.

## OutputFormat:
- Must return a single word: YES or NO.
- All letters must be uppercase to ensure consistent formatting.
